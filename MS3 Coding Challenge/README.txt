A. I've managed to import the file and parse through the information with a scanner. However, writing out to a .db file was a tricky. I got it all written, but I wasn't able to detect which lines had extra content in it. After writing the .db file, I closed the scanner.

B. In order to get the file to work, I needed the file path to do so, and it might need to be changed in order for it to work. The same will need to be done for findind a location for the output. Once your done that, you can run in and open the .db file for yourself.

C. The first thing I did was bring the file into the project. After looking up ways on how to parse through the data, I set that up and had the program read it line by line so it's reusable. Writing it out like can take anywhere from 12-15 minutes, so it may take a while.
